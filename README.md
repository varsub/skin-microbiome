# skin-microbiome
As part of our Public Health Genomics class, students self-swabbed various locations of their body to collect skin microbiome samples. These samples were sequenced and assembled into a library for use on [MicrobiomeAnalayst](https://www.microbiomeanalyst.ca/) for further analysis. All CSV files uploaded to MicrobiomeAnalayst are uploaded to this repository. I then extracted various insights from these data to test two hypotheses:

1. The "grandma hypothesis," proposing that more-washed regions of the body have less diverse skin microbial populations, and
2. Skin microbial populations vary significantly based on body location.

For the purpose of this invstigation, "locations" refer to sites of the body and "regions" refer to more- or less-washed areas. Full classifications and identification of these terms are listed in the Methods section of the final report `Varun Subramaniam_Final Scientific Report.pdf`.
